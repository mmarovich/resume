			"name":"War, Card Game App",
			"url": "https://mmarovich.github.io/war/",
			"detail": "Building this application was an exercise in AJAX, Jquery, javascript, and CSS animation styling. It uses the deck of cards API (deckofcardsapi.com) and the card images and positions on the board are all kept track of by the API itself.  This was a big exercise in using event listeners and controling the flow of asyncronous operations, as well as responsive design."
