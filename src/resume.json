			"name":"Political Hub",
			"url": "https://politics3.herokuapp.com/",
			"detail": "Using Node.js in conjunction with the Google Civics API (https://developers.google.com/civic-information), I was able to build an app where you can log in, enter your location, and receive information on your political representatives.  Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, and user data is currently stored in MongoDB, along with a database for mocha/chai testing."

			"name":"ABC App",
			"url": "https://mmarovich.github.io/ABC-Game/",
			"detail": "This app was created following tutorial on REACT by Abhey Talreja.  I learned how to use .jsons files to plug in text, images, and sounds to my applications.  The course also offered a much-appreciated refresher on logic."
		},
		{
			"name":"Addition App",
			"url": "https://mmarovich.github.io/AdditionApp/",
			"detail": "This was the first app created while learning REACT in Abhey Talreja's Udemy course.  This was a really fun way to learn the basics of REACT, as well as css animations and random number logic."

		{
			"name":"War, Card Game App",
			"url": "https://mmarovich.github.io/war/",
			"detail": "Building this application was an exercise in AJAX, Jquery, javascript, and CSS animation styling. It uses the deck of cards API (deckofcardsapi.com) and the card images and positions on the board are all kept track of by the API itself.  This was a big exercise in using event listeners and controling the flow of asyncronous operations, as well as responsive design."

			"url": "https://mmarovich.github.io/quote-quiz/",
			"detail": "This was my first capstone project at the Thinkful bootcamp.  It demonstrates my ability to effectively use and manipulate state within a single application."
