# Resume

## Description

It's my online resume!

This was actually one of the few times I've ever used a template.  But I liked it so much that I decided to keep it around.  I build this while I was going through a React tutorial on Udemy.

It's kind of cool though because the information is changed in a json file, and the information is accessed by mapping through and referencing that file.  So it's a good way to demonstrate how I can update my information simply by changing the data in a single file.
